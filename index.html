   <h4> The call for improved measures comes as part of the Malicious Communications (Social Media) Bill, which is currently making its way through parliament. The private member's bill (submitted by an MP who doesn't serve in a government party) would see social networks like Facebook and Twitter, and likely include apps like Snapchat and Instagram, to be added to a register of regulated platforms by the Secretary of State.
Speaking to Sky News, Diane Abbott said,  called for Facebook and Twitter to do more to stop abuse being directed at people, while maintaining freedom of speech, and suggested a parliamentary inquiry could look into how the social media firms had responded to hate speech.
 “No one really has a right to peddle this racist and sexist abuse … I think there is probably a case for a parliamentary inquiry, partly to make internet providers do more to close down these people,” she said.
