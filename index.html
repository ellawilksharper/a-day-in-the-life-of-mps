   <p>This sample analysis looks at 35 MPs across parties and provides a snapshot of the sort of online abuse MPs suffer on a regular basis.  Racists, sexist and violent abuse was frequently found in this investigation. 
It has found that women in the Cabinet and Shadow Cabinet, tend to suffer the most abuse online.</p>

  <p>This has led to much support for The Malicious Communications (Social Media) Bill which could pass into law this May. The law would see social networks like Twitter and Facebook at the risk of hefty fines, if they do not tackle online abuse.</p>
  <p>In Februrary, Shadow Home Secretary, Diane Abbott, told Sky News about the online abuse she suffers: “No one really has a right to peddle this racist and sexist abuse … I think there is probably a case for a parliamentary inquiry, partly to make internet providers do more to close down these people”, she said.
