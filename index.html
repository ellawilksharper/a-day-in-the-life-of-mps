  <h1>A Closer Look at Online Abuse Against MPs</h1>
  <h4> MPs have been a target of online abuse and in May 2017, The Malicious Communications (Social Media) Bill could be passed into law. A law that would see social networks like Twitter and Facebook at the risk of hefty fines, if they do not tackle online abuse. Pick an MP below to see what abuse they receive in a day on Twitter. </h4>

   <p>This sample analysis looks at 35 MPs across parties and provides a snapshot of the sort of online abuse MPs suffer on a regular basis. Racists, sexist and violent abuse was frequently found in this investigation. Women were at the brunt of the majority of abuse, with personal attacks on looks most prominent in female MPs.</p>
<p>In February, Shadow Home Secretary, Diane Abbott, told Sky News about the online abuse she suffers: “No one really has a right to peddle this racist and sexist abuse … I think there is probably a case for a parliamentary inquiry, partly to make internet providers do more to close down these people”, she said.<p>
<p>In this project, twitter users were found to tweet Diane Abbott with the word ‘fuck’ 37 times ‘bitch’ 10 times, ‘cunt’ 10 times and 3 racial slurs were found.</p>
